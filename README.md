- 👋 Hi, I’m @jason-carter-bzy
- 👀 I’m interested in technology.  My forte is creating really useful tools for others to use, besides that I'm one of the Beazley DBAs
- 🌱 I’m currently learning our git/teamcity/octo deployment pipeline as I have developed some Cohesity tools stemming database, SSIS, SSRS and PowerShell (nothing like taking on the world eh!)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on SQL and new cool stuff we can use to make our lives easier
- 📫 How to reach me; teams or drop me an email - happy to chat anytime
